            Mangeshkar's career started in 1942 and has spanned over seven decades. She had reportedly recorded not less than 30,000 solo, duet and chorus backed
            songs. She has recorded songs for over a thousand Hindi films and has sung songs in over thirty-six regional Indian languages and foreign languages".
            <br><br>
            I think playback singing has a lot to do with voice acting. I would suggest to all the youngsters to understand the character, situation, and the story
             behind the songs. That is when you can add soul to the rendition which, I think, is missing in todayâ€™s music.
